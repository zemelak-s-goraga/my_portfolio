Project Overview
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Cyclistic, a bike-share company, to explore the differences in bike usage between casual riders and annual members. Using historical trip data from February 2022 to January 2023, the study analyzes key trends such as seasonal peaks, bike type preferences, and ride length variations using SQL, spreadsheets, and R programming. The findings offer actionable insights to develop targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, enhancing Cyclisticâ€™s revenue and market position.

Methodology
The analysis followed a structured approach, leveraging SQL, spreadsheets, and R for data processing, visualization, and insights generation:

Data Importation and Cleaning:

Data was imported from CSV files into Google BigQuery for cleaning and preparation. Missing values were handled, and data consistency was ensured.
Data Manipulation:

SQL queries were used to extract time-related attributes (year, month, day, and time) from ride timestamps. The data was then transformed to align with analysis needs.
Visualization:

Data visualizations were created using Google Sheets and R programming, including line graphs and pivot tables to illustrate trends in ride length, bike type preferences, and usage patterns.
Key Findings
Ride Frequency and Length: Annual members account for 59.3% of rentals and ride more frequently but for shorter durations compared to casual riders, who have longer ride lengths.

Seasonal Patterns: Bike usage peaks from May to September, driven by warmer weather. Both rider groups follow similar trends, though annual members consistently rent more frequently.

Bike Type Preferences: Casual riders prefer electric bikes for ease of use, while annual members tend toward classic bikes, likely for their cost-effectiveness.

Weekly Usage: Rentals are highest on Mondays, with a notable drop on Wednesdays, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions on lower-traffic days.

Implications and Applications
The analysis highlights opportunities for Cyclistic to enhance its marketing strategies by focusing on user behaviors and preferences. Seasonal usage peaks and the popularity of electric bikes among casual riders can inform promotional activities designed to drive membership conversions.

Ethical Considerations
The data used was publicly available and devoid of sensitive personal information. The analysis was conducted transparently, with clear documentation of methodologies to ensure unbiased and reliable results.

Future Directions
Future research should include financial analysis to assess the revenue impact of converting casual riders into annual members. Additionally, investing in more electric bikes could attract casual riders and support membership growth.

Recommendations
Targeted Marketing Campaigns: Focus promotions during peak months (May to September) to encourage casual riders to become annual members.
Expand Electric Bike Availability: Investing in electric bikes can attract more casual riders and drive conversions.
Financial Impact Analysis: Conduct in-depth financial analysis to understand the revenue implications of converting casual riders to members.
