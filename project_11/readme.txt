Project Overview
This report analyzes public sentiment, engagement trends, and key discussion topics surrounding the US Capitol Riots on January 6, 2021, by examining 80,000 tweets. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis and entity recognition, the study identifies prevalent sentiments, influential topics, and the dynamics of social media engagement during crisis events. These insights are valuable for public relations, crisis communication, and sentiment monitoring strategies, providing a deeper understanding of public discourse during significant events.

Methodology
The analysis utilized a systematic approach involving data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and visualization:

Data Preprocessing:

Data was cleaned by normalizing text, removing special characters, and filtering out irrelevant tweets to prepare for sentiment and entity analysis.
Sentiment Analysis:

Sentiment scores were generated using VADER and TextBlob to categorize tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, revealing the overall public mood during the Capitol Riots.
Entity Recognition:

Named Entity Recognition (NER) was conducted using spaCy to identify key topics, political figures, and events frequently mentioned in the tweets.
Correlation Analysis:

Statistical methods were used to explore the relationship between sentiment scores and engagement metrics (likes, retweets), highlighting how public sentiment correlates with tweet interactions.

Visualization:

Various plots, including histograms, word clouds, and bar charts, were created to visualize sentiment distribution, top entities, and engagement trends.

Key Findings
Prevalent Sentiments: The analysis found that negative sentiment dominated the discourse, driven by tweets expressing anger, frustration, and disbelief. The sentiment distribution was heavily skewed towards negativity.

Popular Topics: Frequently mentioned entities included political figures such as Donald Trump and Joe Biden, along with hashtags like #CapitolRiots and #Insurrection. Word clouds visualized the prominence of these topics, highlighting their influence on public discourse.

Engagement Dynamics: Tweets with negative sentiment received higher engagement compared to neutral or positive tweets, suggesting that emotionally charged content resonates more strongly with the public during crises.

Influential Voices: High follower count users, including political commentators and news outlets, were identified as key drivers of the narrative, amplifying specific viewpoints and influencing public sentiment.

Implications and Applications
The findings emphasize the critical role of sentiment in shaping public engagement on social media during crisis events. Negative sentiment drove higher interactions, reflecting the emotional impact of the Capitol Riots on the public. Understanding these dynamics can inform crisis communication strategies, helping stakeholders address public concerns and manage narratives during high-stakes events.

Ethical Considerations
The study used publicly available data from Twitter, ensuring compliance with Twitterâ€™s terms of service. User privacy was respected by anonymizing user details where possible, and the analysis was conducted objectively, acknowledging the limitations and potential biases inherent in user-generated content.

Future Directions
Future research could explore sentiment changes over time during prolonged crises and assess the impact of media coverage on public sentiment. Incorporating other social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram could provide a more comprehensive view of public discourse, supporting real-time adjustments to communication strategies to better align with public expectations and mitigate misinformation.
